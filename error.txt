Was working up until

**
On a profile page, it should show how many warblers that user has liked, and this should link to a page showing their liked warbles.
**

I had a counter working but it was counting likeS and likeD as the same counter

tried adding an alter table messages add likes_count integer default 0

and it wouldn't let me hit enter to alter the table after accessing messages

warbler=# SELECT column_name, data_type
warbler-# FROM information_schema.columns
warbler-# WHERE table_name = 'messages';
 column_name |          data_type          
-------------+-----------------------------
 id          | integer
 text        | character varying
 timestamp   | timestamp without time zone
 user_id     | integer
(4 rows)

warbler=# ALTER TABLE messages
warbler-# ADD COLUMN likes_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
