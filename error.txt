 when clicking the likes number i need to add it so it shows previously liked comments
that i'm sure i'll figure out

but the allowing two people to like one comment and not break it...
i feel like that is more so in the scope of js/ajax no?

let me know if thats something i should just look past for now or if you have any
ideas on how to go about implimenting that

clicking likes takes you to your likes currently 
so i'm giving up i've probably spent some 30 hours on these two parts






viewing users likes to see who liked it

somethings causing an overlaping and not really sure how to go about
trouble shooting that one

viewing likes is busted
viewing liked shows messages liked by the self.user and not other users


probably should Have downloaded the solution
